    "Diffusion models are a type of generative model that have different diffusion-based architectures. In this talktorial we will focus on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). The basic idea of diffusion models is to take an image $ x_0 $ and add guassian noise gradually to it through a series of T steps, that's called forward diffusion. As $q(x_t|x_t-1) $ represents the distribution of the noised images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Followed by reverse diffusion, $x_0$  is reconstructed from the noisy image by learning the conditional probability densities using a neural network model as shown in figure [1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike forward processing, using $q(x_t-1|x_t) $ to denoise the image is impossible since it's intractable.\n",
    "\n",
    "As $ T → \\infty $, $ x_T $ becomes a complete static noise image."
