## Aim of this talktorial

This talktorial introduces and explores the subject of drug-drug interactions (DDI) and their different types, paying special attention to the concepts of antagonism, additivity, and synergism. This will be followed by a closer look at Support Vector Machines (SVM) that use soft margin classifiers and then move towards a more detailed explanation of how to use a combined similarity matrix as a pairwise kernel function to solve the non-linear classification problem of predicting new DDI by comparing them to already known DDI.

To build the combined similarity matrix, we will look at 2D and 3D structural similarity as well as the similarity between interaction profiles and create databases for each of them. The dataset used during the practical part of this talktorial will be retrieved from [__DrugBank__](www.drugbank.ca) and filtered to only contain small molecule drugs that are annotated as approved for medical use in at least one country and for which 2D and 3D structural data is available.
