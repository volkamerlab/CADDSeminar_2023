This will be followed by a closer look at Support Vector Machines (SVM) that use soft margin classifiers and then move towards a more detailed explanation of how to use a combined similarity matrix as a pairwise kernel function to solve the non-linear classification problem of predicting new DDI by comparing them to already known DDI.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build the combined similarity matrix, we will look at 2D and 3D structural similarity as well as the similarity between interaction profiles and create databases for each of them. The dataset used during the practical part of this talktorial will be retrieved from [__DrugBank__](www.drugbank.ca) and filtered to only contain small molecule drugs that are annotated as approved for medical use in at least one country and for which 2D and 3D structural data is available.\n"

    "Clinical investigations and research in the biomedical field showed that to treat more complex diseases the administration of just one drug is often not enough. Diseases like HIV, cancer, or kidney failure, to name a few, often require a combination of drugs to achieve satisfactory results or improvements in the patient's health. However, the simultaneous use of multiple drugs often leads to the occurrence of drug-drug interactions (DDI).\n",
    "\n",
    "DDIs are caused when one drug interferes with another in one or more stages of its lifetime circle in the body and through that influences the effectiveness of said drug. This means they either cause an unexpected medical effect or creates an unexpected but measurable difference in the two drugs' concentration in the patient's bloodstream. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, it does not matter if said influence or effect is beneficial or harmful to the biological system to be classified as a DDI. Thus, while DDI can be taken advantage of to increase a therapeutic effect, they are also a major cause of unwanted or unexpected adverse side effects in patients. Therefore, extensive knowledge about potential DDI is crucial in medical care.\n",
    "\n",
    "From ensuring that the patient doesn't take drugs which are known to negatively affect each other (e.g., causing adverse reactions, making one drug unusable, potentiating side effects to a severely harmful degree), over preventing existing medical conditions from worsening, up to taking advantage of synergistic DDI to give better treatment, knowledge of DDI has a wide field of applications. As such analysing new drugs or drug combinations for potential DDI is an important aspect of the advancement of personalized medicine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since finding and verifying DDI is a costly process due to the amount of in vitro and in vivo experiments, computational means started to develop to filter the large number of potential drug combinations for those who show a high possibility for expressing DDI. Many of these computational methods use machine-learning techniques, such as the one discussed in this talktorial in more detail."

Moreover, a 2D molecular representation is generally available for drugs.\n",

Likewise, with technological improvements and an increased number of experiments researchers collect more and more valuable information which might indicate or prove that previously reported DDIs were the results of other influences independent of the drugs, or vise versa.

    "This talktorial is clearly only an example of how we can use a similarity matrix as a kernel function for predicting DDI and as such has several points where improvements can be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, the bigger the dataset the more reliable the SVM classifier becomes. We only used 50 drugs here, which did create 1225 possible combinations, but that pales compared to the more than 2,500 approved, small molecule drugs currently out on the market (stand: DrugBank, 3 July 2023). Thus, only using 50 of them to train and test the model leaves us with a substantial lack of information and potential bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next aspect that can be improved - as already mentioned in the Theory part of this talktorial - is which features are chosen and how we handle them computationally. Using more varied properties of drugs to determine similarity can improve the accuracy of predictions, and fingerprints are one of the more basic ways of translating chemical information into data that algorithms can work with. There are other methods as well or various intermediate steps to prepare the input data in advance that can affect the results. Likewise, the Tanimoto Coefficient is not the only distance metric that can be used to compare fingerprints and each metric has its strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combined similarity matrix in this talktorial is fairly straightforward as well. We simply performed matrix addition for the pair-wise similarity matrices of the different features. However, if one wants to put more emphasis on one feature over another the different matrices could be weighted by scalar multiplication before being added to each other. Thus, valuing 3D similarity more than 2D similarity for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing a more appropriate value for our Soft Margin Constant *C* via cross-validation can help as well in improving the accuracy of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the above-mentioned improvements are at the discretion of the one setting up the model and depend highly on which input is available and what preferences one has as well as computational capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, an improvement to the above algorithm of the Practical part that should be taken into account is the usage of cross-validation during the fitting process of the SVM classifier. Cross-validation is a good way to prevent overfitting one specific set of training data and allows us to see how well the model does overall on different training data. We chose to not show this during this talktorial because we wanted to focus more on the creation and usage of a similarity matrix for SVM modelling rather than on machine modelling etiquette. Nevertheless, it is something to look into to improve the results of the SVM."

    "Now that we discussed the results and possible algorithmic improvements, it is time to look at the pros and cons of predicting DDI with an SVM that uses a pairwise similarity matrix as a kernel function.\n",
    "\n",
    "PROS:\n",
    "+ __Easy to expand__: The most noticeable advantage of this algorithm is the simplicity with which more features can get added without having to rework the entire program. The pairwise kernel uses a combination of separately computed pairwise similarity matrices. It is easy enough to simply add another similarity matrix to the mix that considers similarity for another property of drugs, like drug-target interactions.\n",
    "+ __High modularity__: In the same way, the high modularity of the algorithm allows tweaking the computation of one feature similarity without having to adjust the computation of the similarity scores of another feature. \n",
    "+ __Feature-Independence__: We can also weigh different features as more important than others, or use a mix of distance measurements to try and improve predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "CONS:\n",
    "- __Lots of setup calculations__: Setting up an SVM with a similarity matrix as a pairwise kernel is not entirely intuitive and requires us a lot of previous calculations. Since all test data has to fit the structure of our similarity matrix before we can predict anything, we have to calculate a lot of fingerprints and similarity values both for the singular drugs as well as for the pairs. We also have to ensure that the resulting vector aligns with the structure of the kernel matrix or predictions will be either impossible or useless due to comparing the wrong values with each other.\n",
    "- __Memory usage__: Furthermore, using so many similarity matrices for storage, checkups, training, and predictions costs a significant amount of memory. Efficient storage methods and exploiting the symmetry of similarity matrices can certainly reduce the amount of memory space needed, but it will still be a lot.\n",
    "- __Data availability__: On that note, the comprehensiveness of the available data for the different drugs is very much a limiting factor for this type of model, be it limiting the number of drugs available for training or the number of features that can be compared for a fixed set of drugs.\n",
    "- __Rerunning algorithm for new drugs__: Another big drawback of the algorithm as described above is that there is no easy way to predict DDI for new drugs without the need to rerun the whole algorithm. This is due to the previously mentioned necessity of test data to be of a certain format, but also because of issues arising with the construction of the interaction profile fingerprints. While MACCS and E3FP fingerprints are standardized, our interaction profile fingerprints are not. The way we construct them assumes that we have no new drugs to add and one comprehensive list and order of the drugs for which we calculate interaction profiles. Said order is the one used in the Exel file we take as input. Hence, to add a new drug, the entire program needs to be run again to ensure all interaction profile fingerprints are consistent and exhaustive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the method to predict DDI via the usage of a pairwise similarity matrix as an SVM kernel has its good and bad sides like any other model and can, if carefully attuned, be a valuable tool to predict possible DDI. Especially when our fingerprints are all standardized. This would reduce the necessity to rerun the whole algorithm and allow for easier adding of new compounds for testing. Using a large set of drugs for the creation of the drug similarity databases can help as well. Especially when only a subset of drug pairs are of interest for comparisons since the calculation of the similarity matrices is where the bulk of computations happens. Once these matrices exist, training the SVMs and predicting DDIs is relatively quick."
