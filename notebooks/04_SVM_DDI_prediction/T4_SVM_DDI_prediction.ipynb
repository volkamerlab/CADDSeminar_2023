    "This talktorial introduces and explores the subject of drug-drug interactions (DDI) and their different types, paying special attention to the concepts of antagonism, additivity, and synergism. This will be followed by a closer look at Support Vector Machines (SVM) that use soft margin classifiers and then move towards a more detailed explanation on how to use a combined similarity matrix as a pairwise kernel function to solve the non-linear classification problem of predicting new DDI by comparing them to already known DDI.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build the combined similarity matrix, we will look at 2D and 3D structural similarity as well as similarity between interaction profiles and create databases for each of them. The dataset used during the practical part of this talktorial will be retrieved from [__DrugBank__](www.drugbank.ca) and filtered to only contain small molecule drugs that are annotated as approved for medical use in at least one country and for which 2D and 3D structural data is available.\n"

    "Clinical investigations and research in the biomedical field showed that to treat more complex diseases the administration of just one drug is often not enough. Diseases like HIV, cancer, or kidney failure, to name a few, often require a combination of drugs to achieve satisfactory results or improvements in the patients' health. However, the simultaneous use of multiple drugs often leads to the occurrence of drug-drug interactions (DDI).\n",
    "\n",
    "DDI are caused when one drug interfers with another in one or more stages of its lifetime circle in the body and through that influences the effectiveness of said drug. This means they either cause an unexpected medical effect or creates an unexpected but measurable difference of the two drugs in the patient's bloodstream. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, it does not matter if said influence or effect is beneficial or harmful to the biological system to be classified as a DDI. Thus, while DDI can be taken advantage of to increase a therapeutic effect, they are also a mayor cause for unwanted or unexpected adverse side effects in patients. Therefore, extensive knowledge about potential DDI is crucial in medical care.\n",
    "\n",
    "From ensuring that the patient doesn't take drugs which are known to negatively affect each other (e.g., causing adverse reactions, making one drug unusable, potentiating side effects to a severely harmful degree), over preventing existing medical conditions from worsening, up to taking advantage of synergistic DDI to give better treatment, knowledge of DDI has a wide field of applications. As such analysing new drugs or drug combinations for potential DDI is an important aspect in the advancement of personalized medicine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since finding and verifying DDI is a costly process due to the amount of in vitro and in vivo experiments, computational means started to develop to filter the large number of potential drug combinations for those who show a high possibility for expressing DDI. Many of these computational methods use machine-learning techniques, such as the one discussed in this talktorial in more detail."

    "Feature selection is a very big part of machine learning algorithms, especially when handling biological data where there are lots of features but only a limited amount of datapoints to use. How one chooses features depends on the availability of the data, the impact said feature might have on the problem at hand, and the computational effort to use it.\n",

    "\n",
    "2D structure is a commonly used feature in drug discovery since it allows for relatively easy first comparisons between drugs and proved reliable enough to build the basis for QSAR methods in pharmacy and drug Discovery. Moreover, a 2D molecular representation is generally available for drugs.\n",
