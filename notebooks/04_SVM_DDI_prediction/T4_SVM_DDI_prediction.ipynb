This will be followed by a closer look at Support Vector Machines (SVM) that use soft margin classifiers and then move towards a more detailed explanation on how to use a combined similarity matrix as a pairwise kernel function to solve the non-linear classification problem of predicting new DDI by comparing them to already known DDI.\n",

    "Clinical investigations and research in the biomedical field showed that to treat more complex diseases the administration of just one drug is often not enough. Diseases like HIV, cancer, or kidney failure, to name a few, often require a combination of drugs to achieve satisfactory results or improvements in the patients' health. However, the simultaneous use of multiple drugs often leads to the occurrence of drug-drug interactions (DDI).\n",
    "\n",
    "DDI are caused when one drug interfers with another in one or more stages of its lifetime circle in the body and through that influences the effectiveness of said drug. This means they either cause an unexpected medical effect or creates an unexpected but measurable difference of the two drugs in the patient's bloodstream. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, it does not matter if said influence or effect is beneficial or harmful to the biological system to be classified as a DDI. Thus, while DDI can be taken advantage of to increase a therapeutic effect, they are also a mayor cause for unwanted or unexpected adverse side effects in patients. Therefore, extensive knowledge about potential DDI is crucial in medical care.\n",
    "\n",
    "From ensuring that the patient doesn't take drugs which are known to negatively affect each other (e.g., causing adverse reactions, making one drug unusable, potentiating side effects to a severely harmful degree), over preventing existing medical conditions from worsening, up to taking advantage of synergistic DDI to give better treatment, knowledge of DDI has a wide field of applications. As such analysing new drugs or drug combinations for potential DDI is an important aspect in the advancement of personalized medicine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since finding and verifying DDI is a costly process due to the amount of in vitro and in vivo experiments, computational means started to develop to filter the large number of potential drug combinations for those who show a high possibility for expressing DDI. Many of these computational methods use machine-learning techniques, such as the one discussed in this talktorial in more detail."

Moreover, a 2D molecular representation is generally available for drugs.\n",

    "This talktorial is clearly only an example on how we can use a similarity matrix as a kernel function for predicting DDI and as such has several points where improvements can be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, the bigger the dataset the more reliable the SVM classifier becomes. We only used 100 drugs here, which certainly creates a large number of possible combinations, but there are far more drugs out on the market that only using 100 of them to train the model leaves us with a substantial lack of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next aspect that can be improved - as already mentioned in the Theory part of this talktorial - is which features are chosen and how we handle them computationally. Using more varied properties of drugs to determine similarity can improve the accuracy of predictions, and fingerprints are one of the more basic ways of translating chemical information into data that algorithms can work with. There are other methods as well or various intermediate steps to prepare the input data in advance that can have an effect on the end results. Likewise, the Tanimoto Coefficient is not the only distance metric that can be used to compare between fingerprints and each metric has their own strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The similarity matrix in this talktorial is fairly straight-forward. We simply performed matrix addition for the pair-wise similarity matrices of the different features. However, if one wants to put more emphasis on one feature over another the different matrices could be weighted by scalar multiplication before being added to each other. Thus, valuing 3D similarity more than 2D similarity for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the above-mentioned improvements are at the discreation of the one setting up the model and depend highly on which input is available and what preferences one has as well as computational capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, an improvement to the above algorithm of the Practical part that should be taken into account is the usage of cross-validation during the fitting process of the SVM classifier. Cross-validation is a good way to prevent overfitting one specific set of training data and allows to see how well the model does overall on different training data. We chose to not show this during this talktorial because we wanted to focus more on the creation and usage of a similarity matrix for SVM modelling rather than on machine modelling etiquette.\n"
